The momentum equation for vertical velocity is:  
        \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial w }{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+2\Omega u cos(\gamma) -g
        \end{equation}
